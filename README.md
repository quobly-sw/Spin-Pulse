**SpinPulse** is an  open-source python package
      for performing simulations of quantum computers based on spin qubits.

This code is licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.



## Installation

You can install **SpinPulse** by running the following command from the root of the repository:
```
    pip install spin_pulse
```

## Main features

- Transpilation of arbitrary circuits to a pulse-level description based on an universal quantum computing model
- Description of noise via a parametrized non-Markovian model
- Integration of pulse-level cicuits to a
      gate-level, which can be plugged into any
      gate-based simulator

Detailed information on our model and the code structure is presented in our [publication]()

## API & Documentation

Our documentation is available [here]().
