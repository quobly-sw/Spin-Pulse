**`SpinPulse`** is an open-source **`python`** package for simulating spin qubit-based quantum computers at the pulse-level.
**`SpinPulse`** models the specific physics of spin qubits, particularly through the inclusion of classical non-Markovian noise.
This enables realistic simulations of native gates and noise-accurate quantum circuits, in order to support hardware development.
