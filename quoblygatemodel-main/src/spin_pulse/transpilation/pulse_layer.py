class PulseLayer:
    """Layer of one- and two-qubit gate pulse sequences.

    A PulseLayer groups single-qubit and two-qubit PulseSequence objects that
    act over a common time interval. Pulse sequences in the layer are eventually
    padded with idle instructions such that all of them share the same duration. The
    layer keeps track of which qubits are driven by one-qubit or two-qubit
    pulses and which qubits remain idle.

    Attributes:
        - duration (int): Duration of the layer, which is the maximal duration
            of the pulse sequences given.
        - qubits (list[qiskit.circuit.Qubit]): Ordered list of qubits included in the layer.
        - num_qubits (int): Number of qubits in the layer.
        - oneq_pulse_sequences (list[PulseSequence]): One-qubit pulse sequence
            assigned to each qubit. For qubits without an explicit drive,
            an idle-only PulseSequence of length duration is created.
        - twoq_pulse_sequences (list[PulseSequence]): Two-qubit pulse sequences
            acting on pair of qubits in the layer.
        - pulse_sequences (list[PulseSequence]): Concatenation of all one- and
            two-qubit pulse sequences in the layer.
        - n_pulses (int): Total number of pulse sequences in the layer.
        - qubits_oneq_active (list[qiskit.circuit.Qubit]): Qubits that are manipulated during the layer
            through single-qubit gate.
        - qubits_twoq_active (list[qiskit.circuit.Qubit]): Qubits that are manipulated during the layer
            through two-qubit gate.
        - qubits_idle (list[qiskit.circuit.Qubit]): Qubits that are idle during this layer.
