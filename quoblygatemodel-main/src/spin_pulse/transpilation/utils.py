    """
    Translate a Qiskit gate (`RX`, `RY`, `RZ`, or `RZZ`) into hardware-compatible
    pulse sequences.

    This function maps high-level Qiskit rotation gates into low-level pulse
    instructions that follow the hardware specifications. Single-qubit rotations
    generate a single PulseSequence, while the ``rzz`` interaction generate two
    qubit sequence followed by a single qubit sequence on each qubit.

    Parameters:
        gate (CircuitInstruction): The Qiskit instruction to translate.
            Supported operations are ``rx``, ``ry``, ``rz``, ``rzz`` and ``delay``.
        hardware_specs (HardwareSpecs): Hardware configuration including available
            fields, ramp durations, and rotation generation routines.

    Returns:
        tuple[list[PulseSequence], list[PulseSequence]]:
            A pair of lists:
            * one-qubit pulse sequences generated from the gate,
            * two-qubit pulse sequences (only for ``rzz``).

    Raises:
        ValueError: If the gate type is not supported.

    Notes:
        For ``rzz`` gates:
            * A central Heisenberg pulse is generated.
            * Pre/post idle ramps are added to ensure smooth pulse shaping.
            * Each qubit receives a compensating detuned Z rotation of equal duration.

        For ``delay`` gates:
            A single IdleInstruction is wrapped in a PulseSequence.

        For single-qubit rotations:
            The corresponding rotation generator in ``hardware_specs`` is invoked.
