# # Noise-accurate simulation of the Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm
#
# The Bernstein–Vazirani (BV) algorithm [[Bernstein, Vazirani, 1993](https://doi.org/10.1137/S0097539796300921)] finds a secret bitstring $s\in\{0, 1\}^n$, knowing the function $f(x)=x\cdot s$, where $\cdot$ denotes the bit-wise dot-product and $x\in\{0, 1\}^n$.
#
# Assuming we have a black-box oracle computing $f$, the algorithm finds $s$ in one call to the oracle, against $n$ calls for a classical algorithm.
#
# In the following, we will estimate the success probability of the BV algorithms in the presence of noise.

# %% [markdown]
# ## Transpilation of the algorithm
#
# We start by generating a `qiskit` circuit implementing the BV algorithm. We use the hidden string to implement the oracle and neglect the consecutive Hadamard gates ($H^2=\mathbb{1}$).
#
# This is clearly a toy example, as we use the hidden string to build the circuit. However, this allows us to measure the impact of noise on the result.

# We first define our hardware specifications and use them to transpile the `qiskit` circuit according to our needs. We can apply Dynamical Decoupling (DD) on idle qubits during single-qubit unitaries by specifying the DD scheme in `HardwareSpecs`.
#
# We then define our `PulseCircuit`s to which we attach the transpiled circuit and the hardware specifications. For the noisy case, we also attach an experimental environment that specifies the noise. Note that we deliberately chose a high level of noise to exhibit the effect of DD even on small circuits.

# There exist two equivalent solutions (in the limit of an infinite number of samples) to compute our success probability.
#
# We can simulate an experiment that performs a bitstring measurement on each realization of the noisy circuit.
# Averaging over multiple realizations gives the probability distribution
# $P(s)=\bra{s}\rho_f\ket{s}$, where $\rho_f$ is the density matrix of the system after running the algorithm.
# In particular, for $s=s_0$ where $s_0$ denotes the hidden string, we obtain the success probability of the algorithm.
#
# Alternatively, noting that
#
# $$\rho_f=\mathbb{E}_u\left[u\ket{0^{\otimes N}}\bra{0^{\otimes N}} u^\dagger\right],$$
#
# where $u$ are the matrices representing the noisy realizations of the quantum circuit, we can recast the success probability as
#
# $$ P(s_0)=\mathbb{E}_u\left[ \left|\bra{s_0}u\ket{0^{\otimes N}}\right|^2\right],$$
#
# and estimate it numerically by calculating the matrices $u$ explicitely, and averaging the overlap $\left|\bra{s_0}u\ket{0^{\otimes N}}\right|^2$ over many noisy circuit realizations.
#
#
# ### Estimating the success probability by simulating an experiment
#
# The first option is implemented by the method `run_experiment` of the `PulseCircuit` class. It executes a single-shot measurement on each noisy instance of the circuit that can be created using the given `ExperimentalEnvironment`.
# Simulations are performed using Matrix Product State (MPS) implementation by `qiskit_aer`.

# ### Estimating the success probability by computing the overlap with the hidden bitstring

# %% [markdown]
#
# The second option consists in computing the overlap $\left|\bra{s_0}u\ket{0^{\otimes N}}\right|^2$ between the hidden bitstring and the state obtained after applying the circuit to $\ket{0^{\otimes N}}$. To take into account the variability of the noise, we compute this overlap for as many noisy instances of the circuit as `ExperimentalEnvironment` can create, and we take the average. This is done by calling `averaging_over_samples`, giving in argument the function `my_success_probability_overlap` that computes the previously mentioned overlap.
#
# In the present case, the overlap is simply the element in the $i$-th row and first column of the unitary operator describing the circuit, with $i$ the integer representation of "1" followed by the hidden bitstring.

    ]
    return np.real(overlap * overlap.conjugate())


# %% [markdown]
