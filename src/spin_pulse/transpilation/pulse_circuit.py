    """Pulse-level representation of a quantum circuit.

    A PulseCircuit stores a layered decomposition of a qiskit.QuantumCircuit into
    PulseLayer objects and, optionally, a stochastic noise environment. It
    provides utilities to visualize the pulse schedule, convert it back to a
    gate-level circuit, and compute fidelities or average channels under
    sampled noise realizations.

    Attributes:
        - original_circ (qiskit.QuantumCircuit): Original quantum circuit from which
            the PulseCircuit was constructed.
        - num_qubits (int): Number of qubits in the circuit.
        - qubits (list[qiskit.circuit.Qubit]): Ordered list of qubits acted on by the circuit.
        - pulse_layers (list[PulseLayer]): Ordered list of pulse layers that
            implement the circuit at the pulse level.
        - n_layers (int): Number of pulse layers.
        - duration (int): Total duration of the pulse circuit, given by the sum
            of all layer durations (in the discrete time unit of the model).
        - t_lab (int): Current position in the laboratory time axis, used to
            attach successive noise time traces when averaging over samples.
